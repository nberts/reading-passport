# 📚 Reading Passport (React Project)

Welcome to the **Reading Passport** project!  
This is a personal coding project where I’m teaching myself React by building a fun reading log app for my child. 

The idea: every book logged is like a new “stamp” in their **passport of reading adventures** ✨.  
There’s already a paper version that they love (big parenting win!), but this is my attempt to digitize it and make it cooler with achievements, badges, and maybe even quizzes later on.  

Will my 8‑year‑old finally be impressed by my coding? Probably not… but one can dream. 😅

## 🚀 Features (Planned & In Progress)
- ✅ Log books (title, author, etc.)
- ✅ Display list of books read
- ⏳ Add ratings, favorite characters, and notes
- ⏳ Unlock achievements & badges for milestones (e.g., 5 books read)
- ⏳ Parent report page with reading stats
- ⏳ (Future) Quizzes about the books to check comprehension

---

## 🛠️ Built With
- [React](https://react.dev/) – my learning focus for this project  
- Vite – lightweight build tool powering the app (because starting React the fast way is always nice)

## 💡 Why This Project?
1. **Learning React**: I’m using this project as my playground for hooks, components, props, and state management.  
2. **Parenting Motivation**: Reading is very important in our family, and I want to nurture a habit of reading by making it fun and trackable.  
3. **Fun Challenge**: Combining personal growth + family inspiration usually means bugs, typos, and lots of coffee.

## 🎯 Roadmap
- [ ] MVP: Add, display, and save books locally
- [ ] Break into reusable React components  
- [ ] Implement simple achievements (badges when reaching milestones)  
- [ ] Add persistent storage (localStorage first, then maybe a database)  
- [ ] Create a parent dashboard/report view  
- [ ] Add quizzes or comprehension questions (stretch goal)

## 🤝 Contributing
This is mostly a personal/learning project, but:
- If you’re building something similar, I’d love to swap notes!  
- Or, if you’re a reader yourself — drop me suggestions for features, or tell me what keeps *you* motivated to log books.  

---

## 😂 Fun Notes
- Estimated 40% of this project time will be spent chasing down a single typo.  
- My child: “Eh, it’s okay.”  
- Me: *sheds proud coding-parent tear*
